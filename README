http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/toolkit/ts2po?redirect=1
ts2po translation_extracted.ts translation_extracted.po
po2ts translation_extracted.po translation_extracted.ts


php runcronjobs.php -d -c extract_ts_file_from_original_ts_file
This CRON used as a CLI extract data from all translation.ts having the specified context into a file translation_extracted.ts.
So as to allow PoEdit to used key specfied several times, we temporary add the context to the .po key using this format (CONTEXT)KEY

You then can send all translation_extracted.po files to translation using PoEdit

Once .po file are completed, you can put back the .po file where they were generated first and launch the CRON bellow
php runcronjobs.php -d -c include_ts_file_into_original_ts_file
It will insert all data from the .po file to the translation.ts file in the same folder. And this for each translation.ts file you can have in your extensions and share files.


Don't forget to add your extension in your site.ini settings 

[ExtensionSettings]
ActiveExtensions[]
ActiveExtensions[]=convert_file_ts_to_po

And to change the context in extension/convert_file_ts_to_po/classes/I18nFile.php
CONST CONTEXT_NAME = 'xxx';
